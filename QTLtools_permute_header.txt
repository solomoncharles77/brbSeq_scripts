1    	phe_id | grp_id	The phenotype ID or if one of the grouping options is provided, then phenotype group ID
2    	phe_chr	The phenotype chromosome
3    	phe_from	Start position of the phenotype
4    	phe_to	End position of the phenotype
5    	phe_strd	The phenotype strand
5.1    	phe_id | ve_by_pc1 | n_phe_in_grp	Only printed if --group-best | --group-pca1 | --group-mean. The phenotype ID, variance explained by PC1, or number of phenotypes in the phenotype group for --group-best, --group-pca1, and --group-mean, respectively.
5.2    	n_phe_in_grp	Only printed if --group-pca1 | --group-mean. The number of phenotypes in the phenotype group.
6    	n_var_in_cis	The number variants in the cis window for this phenotype.
7    	dist_phe_var	The distance between the variant and the phenotype start positions.
8    	var_id	The most significant variant ID.
9    	var_chr	The most significant variant's chromosome.
10    	var_from	The start position of the most significant variant.
11    	var_to	The end position of the most significant variant.
12    	dof1	The number of degrees of freedom used to compute the p-values.
13    	dof2	Estimated number of degrees of freedom used in beta approximation p-value calculations.
14    	bml1	The first shape parameter of the fitted beta distribution (alpha parameter). These should be close to 1.
15    	bml2	The second shape parameter of the fitted beta distribution (beta parameter). This corresponds to the effective number of independent tests in the region.
16    	nom_pval	The nominal p-value of the association between the most significant variant and the phenotype.
17    	r_squared	The r squared of the linear regression.
18    	slope	The beta (slope) of the linear regression.
18.1    	slope_se	The standard error of the beta. Only printed if --std-err is provided.
19    	adj_emp_pval	Adjusted empirical p-value from permutations. This is the adjusted p-value not using the beta approximation. Simply calculated as: (number of p-values observed during permutations that were smaller than or equal to the nominal p-value + 1) / (number of permutations + 1). The most significant p-value achievable would be 1 / (number of permutations + 1).
20    	adj_beta_pval	Adjusted empirical p-value given by the fitted beta distribution. We strongly recommend using this adjusted p-value in any downstream analysis.
